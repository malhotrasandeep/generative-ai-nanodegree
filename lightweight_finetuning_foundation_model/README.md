## Summary ##
Yhis project applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library.

### Steps
1) Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
2) Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
3) Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
